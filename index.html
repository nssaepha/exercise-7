      <p>
				Hii! Welcolme to my blog! To whom is reading, this is Naihla, pronounced NY-LA but most people call me Nai. Thats me! <strong> (on the far right) </strong> and those are my two best friends beside me with whom I share countless memories and adventures with. 
        <br>  
				<br>
        I’m a full time student at the University of Waterloo studying Global Business and Digital Arts <strong> (i almost ran out of breath reading that too)</strong>. I am in my second year of the program going into my 2B term this winter. Unlike a lot of people I cross paths with, I was born and raised in Waterloo and have lived here my whole life. When deciding on post secondary, I chose Waterloo because it’s close to home, the program is one of a kind, and I want to study abroad during my fourth term! I am passionate about design, business, and user experience and look forward to a career in this field post-graduation.
      <p>For any inquires regarding design projects, you can reach me through my school email <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">here</a>. 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I come from a busy household of six. I have 3 sibilings, 1 older and 2 younger, all sisters <strong> (yes, I can feel the sympathy for my dad pouring in)</strong>. My roots are a vibrant mix of Jamaican and Laotian heritage. It's always amusing to see people try to guess my ethnicity; the most common guesses include Cambodian, Filipina, or Thai. I once even got Latina lol! 
        <br>
        <br> 
        When I’m not studying I spend my time working. I work part time at Footlocker and on top of that, I proudly manage my own business, <i>NaiBeauti</i>. Offering lash and nail services, I collaborate with women of all ages, helping them embrace and enhance their natural beauty.
        <br> 
        <br>
        My journey into the world of beauty started at the age of 16 when I got my eyelashes done for the first time ever and fell in love. I was obsessed with the way it made me feel. It was a transformative experience that left me feeling confident and beautiful. Since then, I have been getting them done since and was granted the oppurtunity to experince being on the other side of the service.
        <br>

        Being a business owner is more than a title to me; it's a journey filled with goals achieved, milestones reached, and doors opened.

        <br>
        Until next time!
