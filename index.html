        <h2>Who Is Naihla Dawkins?</h2>
      <p>
				Hii! Welcolme to my blog! To whom is reading, this is Naihla, pronounced NY-LA. (not too sure why my parents spelt it like that either). Thats me! (on the far right) and those are my two best friends beside me whom I spend a lot of my time with. 
        <br>  
       	 <br>
        I’m a full time student at the University of Waterloo studying Global Business and Digital Arts (i almost ran out of breath reading that too). I am in my second year of the program going into my 2B term this fall. Unlike a lot of people I cross paths with, I was born and raised in Waterloo and have lived here my whole life. When deciding on post secondary, I chose Waterloo because it’s close to home and I want to study abroad during my fourth term!
        <br> 
        <br> 
        I come from a family of 6. I have 3 sibilings, 1 older and 2 younger, all sisters (yes my dad loves being the only man in the house). I'm half Jamaican and half Laotion. Whenever I ask people to guess my enthinicy I usually get Cambodian, Filipina, or Thai, I once even got Latina lol. 
        <br>
        <br> 
        When I’m not studying I spend my time working. I work part time at Footlocker and run my own business, NaiBeauti. I offer both lash and nail services, working with women of all ages to feel beautiful in thier own skin. 
        <br> 
        <br>
        When I was 16, I got my eyelashes done for the first time ever and fell in love. I was obsessed with the way it made me feel. Confident and beautiful. Since then, I have been getting them done since and was granted the oppurtunity to experince being on the other side of the service.
        <br>
        <br>
        I love being a business owner because of the goals I get to accomplosh, milestones i reach, and doors it opens.
